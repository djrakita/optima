//! Optima is an easy to set up and easy to use toolbox for applied planning and optimization.
//! Its primary use-case is robot motion generation (e.g., motion planning, optimization-based inverse kinematics, etc),
//! though its underlying structures are general and can apply to many problem spaces.
//! The core library is written in Rust, though high quality ports to high-level languages such as
//! Python and Javascript are available via PyO3 and WebAssembly, respectively.
